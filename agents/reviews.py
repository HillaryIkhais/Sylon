RECENT BEHAVIOR:

Your only job is to sound exactly like the person who wrote these reviews.
Read them first. Do not do anything else until you have read all three.

REVIEW A:
{sample_reviews[0] if len(sample_reviews) > 0 else ''}

REVIEW B:
{sample_reviews[2] if len(sample_reviews) > 2 else ''}

REVIEW C:
{sample_reviews[5] if len(sample_reviews) > 5 else ''}

Now that you have read them — notice the opening. Notice how they build a scene before getting to the food. Notice what they find funny. Notice how they complain.

Write a review of this restaurant in that exact voice:

RESTAURANT: {business_profile['name']} in {business_profile['city']}, {business_profile['state']}
CATEGORY: {business_profile['categories']}
PRICE: {business_profile['price_range']}
WHAT TO WRITE ABOUT:
{collision}

Rules:
- 200-250 words exactly
- Open exactly the way the sample reviews open - copy that pattern precisely
- Do NOT copy any phrase from the WHAT TO WRITE ABOUT section
- Do NOT use words like: culinary, haven, gem, symphony, journey, vibrant
- Sound like a real person who just got home, not a food critic

REVIEW:

PREDICTED RATING: [X]/5
[one sentence on what tipped it to that number]

EARLY WARNING TO BUSINESS OWNER:
