## Global AI Hackathon with Qwen Cloud
**For the Judges:** Sylon is purpose-built to win **Track 3 (Agent Society)** with elements of Track 4. Here is exactly how we hit the judging criteria:

1. **Architectural Quality (Track 3 Core):** Sylon is not a chatbot; it is a highly concurrent Multi-Agent Decision Engine. The Qwen Orchestrator routes tasks to isolated Sales and Inventory agents via a custom `Promise.all()` parallel state machine.
2. **Conflict Resolution & Autonomy:** When the Sales Agent and Inventory Agent disagree on a customer request, Sylon utilizes a strict Conflict Resolution tie-breaker to reach a consensus without human intervention.
3. **Sophisticated API Usage (MCP):** Sylon natively bypasses manual integrations by strictly adhering to the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. Our MCP Executor securely translates Qwen Cloud's consensus into a direct API execution back to the user.
4. **Proof of Deployment:** The entire backend is orchestrated on **Alibaba Cloud Serverless App Engine (SAE)** with our Business Memory Graph physically hosted on **Alibaba Cloud RDS**.

## The Problem: The Death of the Dashboard
Modern business intelligence is fundamentally broken. Traditional platforms ingest millions of data points only to spit out static star ratings and sterile dashboards. They tell a business owner *what* happened, but they fail to explain *who* is angry, *why* their expectations shifted, and *how* a specific operational pivot will impact churn. 

Dashboards do not solve problems. Agents do.

## The Solution: Sylon
Sylon moves beyond collaborative filtering by treating customers as **evolving psychological entities**. 

Built natively on **Qwen Cloud**, Sylon ingests raw, unstructured data and mathematically excavates distinct customer archetypes. It acts as an autonomous conversational strategist. When a business owner proposes a change (e.g., *"If I raise prices by 15%, what happens?"*), Sylon triggers a highly concurrent, Multi-Agent simulation powered by Qwen-Max to debate the outcome in real-time.

## Architecture: The "Board of Directors" Pipeline

To achieve mathematical rigor without LLM hallucination, Sylon relies on a synchronized 4-Agent Pipeline executed via concurrent threading on Alibaba Cloud.

```

1. **The CFO Agent (Margin Safety):** Evaluates the strict financial impact of the proposed scenario, optimizing for revenue retention.
2. **The CX Agent (Churn Risk):** Analyzes the exact psychological personas excavated from the dataset to predict customer outrage or delight.
3. **The Ops Agent (Friction):** Evaluates supply chain, staff training, and ground-level execution friction.
4. **The Synthesizer (Sylon Core):** Synthesizes the internal debate and outputs a cohesive, actionable directive to the business owner.

This entire debate is streamed live to the Next.js frontend, exposing the raw "thinking" of the Qwen models to the user before delivering the final recommendation.

## Local Development

Sylon is fully containerized for instant deployment.

1. **Clone & Configure:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HillaryIkhais/Sylon.git
   cd Sylon
   ```
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=your_qwen_cloud_api_key
   QWEN_MODEL=qwen-max
   SYLON_DB_PATH=data/sylon.db
   ```

2. **Spin up the Cluster:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the Engine:** Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
